# RegressionAnalysis_matplotlibcpp
Regression analysis tool (class regression) utilizing matplotlibcpp.h to graph the results.
Using .txt files as input, the following can be made:
  - Regression models
     ~ Linear (2-part linear is an option)
     ~ Exponential
     ~ Logarithmic
     ~ Power
     ~ Second-Degree polynomium [Adjustablue in code]
 - Correlation coefficient(s) hereof [R^2]
 - Graph of regression models
 - Other statistical descriptors [MORE PENDING]
## TO BE DONE:
1. Get scientific values of "inprecise" fixed values
2. 2. Get additional statistical descriptors
